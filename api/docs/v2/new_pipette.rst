Opentrons pipettes are configurable devices used to move liquids throughout the working area during the execution of protocols. Flex and OT-2 each have their own pipettes, which are available for use in the Python API.

Pages in this section of the documentation cover:

    - :ref:`Loading pipettes <loading-pipettes>` into your protocol.
    - :ref:`Pipette characteristics <pipette-characteristics>`, such as how fast they can move liquid and how they move around the deck.
    - :ref:`Partial tip pickup <partial-tip-pickup>` configurations for multi-channel pipettes. Full and partial tip pickup configurations can be combined in a single protocol.
    - The :ref:`volume modes <pipette-volume-modes>` of Flex 50 ÂµL pipettes, which must operate in low-volume mode to accurately dispense very small volumes of liquid. 

For information about liquid handling, see :ref:`v2-atomic-commands` and :ref:`v2-complex-commands`.
