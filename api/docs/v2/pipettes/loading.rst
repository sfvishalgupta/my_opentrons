Loading Pipettes
****************

When writing a protocol, you must inform the Protocol API about the pipettes you will be using on your robot. The :py:meth:`.ProtocolContext.load_instrument` function provides this information and returns an :py:class:`.InstrumentContext` object.

As noted above, you call the :py:meth:`~.ProtocolContext.load_instrument` method to load a pipette. This method also requires the :ref:`pipette's API load name <new-pipette-models>`, its left or right mount position, and (optionally) a list of associated tip racks. Even if you don't use the pipette anywhere else in your protocol, the Opentrons App and the robot won't let you start the protocol run until all pipettes loaded by ``load_instrument()`` are attached properly.

API Load Names
==============

The pipette's API load name (``instrument_name``) is the first parameter of the ``load_instrument()`` method. It tells your robot which attached pipette you're going to use in a protocol. The tables below list the API load names for the currently available Flex and OT-2 pipettes.

        See the :ref:`OT-2 Pipette Generations <ot2-pipette-generations>` section if you're using GEN1 pipettes on an OT-2. The GEN1 family includes the P10, P50, and P300 single- and multi-channel pipettes, along with the P1000 single-channel model.

Loading Flex 1- and 8-Channel Pipettes
======================================

This code sample loads a Flex 1-Channel Pipette in the left mount and a Flex 8-Channel Pipette in the right mount. Both pipettes are 1000 µL. Each pipette uses its own 1000 µL tip rack.  

.. code-block:: Python
    :substitutions:

    from opentrons import protocol_api
    
    requirements = {"robotType": "Flex", "apiLevel":"|apiLevel|"}

    def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
        tiprack1 = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", location="D1")
        tiprack2 = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", location="C1")       
        left = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="flex_1channel_1000",
            mount="left",
            tip_racks=[tiprack1])                
        right = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="flex_8channel_1000",
            mount="right",
            tip_racks=[tiprack2]) 

If you're writing a protocol that uses the Flex Gripper, you might think that this would be the place in your protocol to declare that. However, the gripper doesn't require ``load_instrument``! Whether your gripper requires a protocol is determined by the presence of :py:meth:`.ProtocolContext.move_labware` commands. See :ref:`moving-labware` for more details.

Loading a Flex 96-Channel Pipette
=================================

This code sample loads the Flex 96-Channel Pipette. Because of its size, the Flex 96-Channel Pipette requires the left *and* right pipette mounts. You cannot use this pipette with 1- or 8-Channel Pipette in the same protocol or when these instruments are attached to the robot. Load the 96-channel pipette as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
        pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="flex_96channel_1000"
        )

In protocols specifying API version 2.15, also include ``mount="left"`` as a parameter of ``load_instrument()``.

.. versionadded:: 2.15
.. versionchanged:: 2.16
    The ``mount`` parameter is optional.

Loading OT-2 Pipettes
=====================

This code sample loads a P1000 Single-Channel GEN2 pipette in the left mount and a P300 Single-Channel GEN2 pipette in the right mount. Each pipette uses its own 1000 µL tip rack. 

.. code-block:: python
    :substitutions:

    from opentrons import protocol_api

    metadata = {"apiLevel": "|apiLevel|"}

    def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
        tiprack1 = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul", location=1)
        tiprack2 = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul", location=2)
        left = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="p1000_single_gen2",
            mount="left",
            tip_racks=[tiprack1])
        right = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="p300_multi_gen2",
            mount="right",
            tip_racks=[tiprack1])

.. versionadded:: 2.0

.. _pipette-tip-racks:

Adding Tip Racks
================

The ``load_instrument()`` method includes the optional argument ``tip_racks``. This parameter accepts a list of tip rack labware objects, which lets you to specify as many tip racks as you want. You can also edit a pipette's tip racks after loading it by setting its :py:obj:`.InstrumentContext.tip_racks` property.

.. note::
    Some methods, like :py:meth:`.configure_nozzle_layout`, reset a pipette's tip racks. See :ref:`partial-tip-pickup` for more information.

The advantage of using ``tip_racks`` is twofold. First, associating tip racks with your pipette allows for automatic tip tracking throughout your protocol. Second, it removes the need to specify tip locations in the :py:meth:`.InstrumentContext.pick_up_tip` method. For example, let's start by loading loading some labware and instruments like this::
        
    def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
        tiprack_left = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_200ul", location="D1")
        tiprack_right = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_200ul", location="D2")
        left_pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="flex_8channel_1000", mount="left")
        right_pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
            instrument_name="flex_8channel_1000",
            mount="right",
            tip_racks=[tiprack_right])

Let's pick up a tip with the left pipette. We need to specify the location as an argument of ``pick_up_tip()``, since we loaded the left pipette without a ``tip_racks`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    left_pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack_left["A1"])
    left_pipette.drop_tip()

But now you have to specify ``tiprack_left`` every time you call ``pick_up_tip``, which means you're doing all your own tip tracking::

    left_pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack_left["A2"])
    left_pipette.drop_tip()
    left_pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack_left["A3"])
    left_pipette.drop_tip()

However, because you specified a tip rack location for the right pipette, the robot will automatically pick up from location ``A1`` of its associated tiprack::
    
    right_pipette.pick_up_tip()
    right_pipette.drop_tip()

Additional calls to ``pick_up_tip`` will automatically progress through the tips in the right rack::

    right_pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up from A2
    right_pipette.drop_tip()
    right_pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up from A3
    right_pipette.drop_tip()
       
.. versionadded:: 2.0

See also :ref:`v2-atomic-commands` and :ref:`v2-complex-commands`.

.. _pipette-trash-containers:

Adding Trash Containers
=======================

The API automatically assigns a :py:obj:`.trash_container` to pipettes, if one is available in your protocol. The ``trash_container`` is where the pipette will dispose tips when you call :py:meth:`.drop_tip` with no arguments. You can change the trash container, if you don't want to use the default. 

One example of when you might want to change the trash container is a Flex protocol that goes through a lot of tips. In a case where the protocol uses two pipettes, you could load two trash bins and assign one to each pipette::

    left_pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
        instrument_name="flex_8channel_1000", mount="left"
    )
    right_pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
        instrument_name="flex_8channel_50", mount="right"
    )
    left_trash = load_trash_bin("A3")
    right_trash = load_trash_bin("B3")
    left_pipette.trash_container = left_trash
    right_pipette.trash_container = right_trash

Another example is a Flex protocol that uses a waste chute. Say you want to only dispose labware in the chute, and you want the pipette to drop tips in a trash bin. You can implicitly get the trash bin to be the pipette's ``trash_container`` based on load order, or you can ensure it by setting it after all the load commands::

    pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
        instrument_name="flex_1channel_1000",
        mount="left"
    )
    chute = protocol.load_waste_chute()  # default because loaded first
    trash = protocol.load_trash_bin("A3")
    pipette.trash_container = trash  # overrides default

.. versionadded:: 2.0
.. versionchanged:: 2.16
    Added support for ``TrashBin`` and ``WasteChute`` objects.

.. _lpd:

Liquid Presence Detection
=========================

Liquid presence detection is a pressure-based feature that allows Opentrons Flex pipettes to detect the presence or absence of liquids in a well, reservoir, tube, or other container. It gives you the ability to identify, avoid, and recover from liquid-related protocol errors.

When detecting liquid, the pipette slowly moves a fresh, empty tip downward from the top of the well until it contacts the liquid. The downward probing motion can take anywhere from 5 to 50 seconds, depending on the depth of the well and how much liquid it contains. For example, it will take much less time to detect liquid in a full flat well plate than in an empty (or nearly empty) large tube.

You can enable this feature for an entire protocol run or toggle it on and off as required. Consider the amount of time automatic detection will add to your protocol. If you only need to detect liquid infrequently, use the :ref:`corresponding building block commands <detect-liquid-presence>` instead. Automatic liquid presence detection is disabled by default.

Pipette Compatibility
---------------------

Liquid presence detection works with Flex 1-, 8-, and 96-channel pipettes only. 1-channel pipettes have one pressure sensor. The 8-channel pipette pressure sensors are on channels 1 and 8 (positions A1 and H1). The 96-channel pipette pressure sensors are on channels 1 and 96 (positions A1 and H12). Other channels on multi-channel pipettes do not have sensors and cannot detect liquid.

Enabling Globally
-----------------

To automatically use liquid presence detection, add the optional Boolean argument  ``liquid_presence_detection=True`` to :py:meth:`.ProtocolContext.load_instrument` in your protocol. The robot will check for liquid on every aspiration. You can also turn this feature off and back on again later in a protocol. This example enables liquid presence detection on the 8-channel pipette used in the sample protocol at the top of the page.

.. code-block:: python

    right = protocol.load_instrument(
        instrument_name="flex_8channel_1000",
        mount="right",
        tip_racks=[tiprack2],
        liquid_presence_detection=True
    )

.. note::
    Accurate liquid detection requires fresh, dry pipette tips. Protocols using this feature must discard used tips after an aspirate/dispense cycle and pick up new tips before the next cycle. :ref:`Complex commands <v2-complex-commands>` may include aspirate steps after a tip is already wet. When global liquid detection is enabled, use :ref:`building block commands <v2-atomic-commands>` to ensure that your protocol picks up a tip immediately before aspiration.

    The API will not raise an error during liquid detection if a tip is empty but wet. It will raise an error if liquid detection is active and your protocol attempts to aspirate with liquid in the tip.

Let's take a look at how all this works. With automatic liquid detection enabled, tell the robot to pick up a clean tip, aspirate 100 µL from a reservoir, and dispense that volume into a well plate:

.. code-block:: python
    
    right.pick_up_tip()
    right.aspirate(100, reservoir["A1"])  # checks for liquid
    right.dispense(100, plate["A1"])

Liquid detection takes place prior to aspiration. Upon detecting a liquid, the pipette stops, raises itself above the liquid's surface, and then aspirates according to your protocol. Checking for a liquid adds time to your protocol run, so be aware of that before using it. If Flex doesn't detect liquid, it raises an error and stops the protocol until the problem is resolved.

However, aspiration isn't required for liquid level detection. Two standalone methods, :py:meth:`.detect_liquid_presence` and :py:meth:`.require_liquid_presence`, let you add liquid detection to a protocol with or without aspirating. Automatic detection is the same as calling ``require_liquid_presence()`` before every aspiration. See :ref:`detect-liquid-presence` and :ref:`require-liquid-presence` for details.

.. versionadded:: 2.20

Activating and Deactivating
---------------------------

You can turn liquid presence detection off and on throughout a protocol. To turn it off, set ``pipette.liquid_presence_detection=False`` at the point in a protocol where it needs to be disabled, usually between picking up a new tip and aspirating a liquid. This overrides the global argument, ``liquid_presence_detection=True`` that we set on :py:meth:`~.ProtocolContext.load_instrument`. Let's try this  after picking up a new tip. 

.. code-block:: python
    
    right.pick_up_tip()
    right.liquid_presence_detection = False  # Turns off liquid presence detection.
    right.aspirate(100, reservoir["A2"])     # Aspirates immediately.

From now on, the pipette will not check for liquid until you turn this feature back on. 

To reactivate, set ``liquid_presence_detection=True`` at the point later in the protocol where it needs to be enabled, usually between picking up a new tip and aspirating a liquid.

.. code-block:: python

    right.pick_up_tip()
    right.liquid_presence_detection = True  # Turns on liquid presence detection.
    right.aspirate(100, reservoir["A3"])    # Detects liquid before aspirating.

The robot will continue to check for liquid until this feature is disabled again, or an empty well is detected (and the robot raises an error), or the protocol completes.

.. versionadded:: 2.20
