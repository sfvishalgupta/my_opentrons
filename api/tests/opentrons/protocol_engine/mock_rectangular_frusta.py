"""Mock representations of potential rectangular frusta."""
"""
These are rectangular frusta whose length and width decay regularly, though not necessarily at the same rate.
Height always decays from the max height to 0 in increments of 1.
This has frusta with widths and lengths that both grow and decay with respect to positive change in height.
