    * `"failRun"`: Fail the run.

    * `"waitForRecovery"`: Enter interactive error recovery mode. You can then
      perform error recovery with `POST /runs/{id}/commands` and exit error
      recovery mode with `POST /runs/{id}/actions`.

    * `"assumeFalsePositiveAndContinue"`: Continue the run without interruption, acting
      as if the error was a false positive.

      This is equivalent to doing `"waitForRecovery"`
      and then sending `actionType: "resume-from-recovery-assuming-false-positive"`
      to `POST /runs/{id}/actions`, except this requires no ongoing intervention from
      the client.

    * `"ignoreAndContinue"`: Continue the run without interruption, accepting whatever
      state the error left the robot in.

      This is equivalent to doing `"waitForRecovery"`
      and then sending `actionType: "resume-from-recovery"` to `POST /runs/{id}/actions`,

      This is probably not useful very often because it's likely to cause downstream
      errorsâ€”imagine trying an `aspirate` command after a failed `pickUpTip` command.
