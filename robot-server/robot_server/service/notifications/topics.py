"""MQTT topics for server-emitted notifications.

These are the MQTT functional equivalent of HTTP endpoints.
Each topic should generally be named after the HTTP endpoint whose data it's reflecting.

It's helpful to have these centralized in this one file so we can see all the topics
that we currently support.
